# messagecloner
Simple utility to copy messages from one message broker to another.

The tool was created to allow creating copies of messages published to one
broker and send them to another one (supported by kombu). It binds to specified
exchanges on the source broker and publishes the messages to corresponding
queues on the target broker.

## usage
For the usage please refer to `messagecloner --help`. Note that in addition it
is possible to specify broker credentials by setting `SOURCE_BROKER_CREDENTIALS`
and `TARGET_BROKER_CREDENTIALS` environment variables as `user:password`.

    usage: messagecloner [-h]
                         [--source-transport-options SOURCE_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS]
                         [--target-transport-options TARGET_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS]
                         --exchange-queue-pair SRC_EXCHANGE TARGET_QUEUE [-v]
